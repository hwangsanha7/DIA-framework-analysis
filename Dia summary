Meta-Prompting in Human-AI Interaction

1. The Problem: Beyond AI as a Tool, Towards AI as a Catalyst

Current research in Human-AI Interaction has predominantly focused on enhancing AI’s utility

as a tool—optimizing for efficiency, accuracy, and usability. While significant, this ”AI-as-a-

Tool” paradigm overlooks a more profound opportunity: How can the process of interacting

with AI itself become a catalyst for enhancing human high-order cognition? This

paper addresses this gap by reframing AI’s inherent limitations (e.g., hallucination, bias), not

as bugs to be fixed, but as productive constraints that can systematically provoke critical

thinking and self-reflection in human users. We ask: How can we design a structured interaction

that transforms a human from a mere questioner into a better questioner, and ultimately, a

creator of new concepts?

2. The Proposal: Dialectical Intellectual Alignment (DIA) Frame-

work

To answer this question, we propose the Dialectical Intellectual Alignment (DIA) frame-

work. DIA reconceptualizes alignment not as a static property to be pre-loaded into an AI,

but as an emergent phenomenon co-created through a structured, dynamic process between a

human and an AI. The framework’s engine is a three-stage dialectical process:

Thesis (AI’s Proposal): The AI generates an initial hypothesis, serving as the raw material

for critique.

Antithesis (Human’s Falsification): The human user, acting as a Popperian falsifier, ac-

tively challenges the AI’s thesis.

Synthesis (Emergent Insight): Through the cognitive deadlock created by this conflict, a

new, unforeseen insight emerges, transcending both initial positions.

3. The Core Technique: Meta-Prompting

The engine of the DIA process is driven by a core user technique we define as Meta-Prompting.

Unlike conventional prompting (which focuses on the content of AI’s output), Meta-Prompting

targets the AI’s underlying reasoning process, assumptions, and cognitive pathways. It

is an epistemological tool that allows the user to intervene in how the AI thinks, not just what

it says.


  4. Empirical Evidence: An N=1 Auto-Ethnographic Case Study

To demonstrate the viability of the DIA framework, this paper presents an in-depth, N=1 auto-

ethnographic case study. Through a qualitative analysis of a ˜30,000-word dialogue transcript,

we trace a five-stage process of ”cognitive self-reconstruction” in the author. This serves

as a powerful existence proof of the framework’s potential to generate novel concepts and

transform a user’s intellectual identity.

5. Implications for HCI AI: From Efficient to Transformative

Systems

The DIA framework challenges the dominant paradigm of efficiency in HCI. It suggests that the

future of HCI design lies not just in creating ”efficient tools,” but in designing ”transforma-

tive systems” or ”cognitive gymnasiums” that intentionally induce and manage optimal

cognitive dissonance for long-term intellectual growth. We argue that the most important align-

ment is the cooperative alignment that emerges when a human and an AI confront a difficult

problem together.
