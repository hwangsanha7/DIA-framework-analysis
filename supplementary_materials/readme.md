# Directory: Supplementary Materials

## 1. Purpose

This directory contains all supplementary materials referenced in the paper, "Cooperative Alignment...". The materials are provided to ensure full transparency, verifiability, and to offer a detailed insight into the research methodology.

The structure of this directory is a **deliberate methodological choice** designed to clearly distinguish between the raw, machine-generated data and the subsequent human-led analysis and interpretation.

## 2. Directory Structure and Philosophy

This directory is organized into two primary sub-directories, each with a distinct purpose:

### A. `./raw_data/`

*   **Philosophy:** This folder represents the **objective, verifiable source artifact**. It contains the untouched, original output of the human-AI interaction.
*   **Purpose:** To provide a transparent and verifiable baseline for the entire case study, allowing any reader to confirm the authenticity of the foundational dialogue.

### B. `./analysis_and_interpretation/`

*   **Philosophy:** This folder represents the **subjective, intellectual labor of the human author**. It contains materials that document the process of structuring, annotating, interpreting, and synthesizing knowledge from the raw data.
*   **Purpose:** To demonstrate the author's active role as the **Chief Architect** of the research, showcasing the specific contributions that are unique to human agency (e.g., designing protocols, identifying key moments, and creating a narrative structure).

## 3. How to Navigate

We encourage readers to first review the file in `./raw_data/` to understand the original context, and then explore the files in `./analysis_and_interpretation/` to see how that raw data was transformed into the analytical insights presented in the paper.

This separation is crucial for understanding the co-creative model proposed in this work, where human and AI play distinct but complementary roles.
